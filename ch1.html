    <P> I think what the writer means by 'gap instinct' is that people tend to compare things and people and that can create gaps between them. It's like when you see two people and you start comparing them based on some criteria, like their job or their appearance. When you do that, you start to see differences between them and that creates a gap in your mind. But in reality, both people are just human beings and there is no gap between two humans.

        For example, if you see a small shopkeeper and a working employee, you might think that the employee is superior and the shopkeeper is inferior. But that's not true because both of them are just human beings trying to make a living. By comparing them and pointing out their differences, you're creating a gap between them.
        
        The writer is trying to teach us not to compare ourselves to anyone else and not to consider ourselves inferior to others. Instead, we should focus on our own strengths and abilities and work towards improving ourselves. This way, we can avoid feeling inferior to others and can learn to appreciate our own unique qualities.</P>
