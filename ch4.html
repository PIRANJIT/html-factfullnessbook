    <P>The fear instinct refers to when we are more afraid of failing than desiring success. This fear causes us to focus more on the frightening aspects rather than the actual work. The writer emphasizes that success isn't easy; it's an important achievement, and important things are often challenging. However, when we let fear consume our thoughts, these challenges can feel insurmountable.

        The author illustrates this fear with an example: Imagine having to jump over a river. While the river might not be too wide to jump across, if someone suggests you might fall in, fear could prevent you from attempting the jump. Similarly, this concept applies to our pursuit of success. Whether it's starting a business or pursuing a job, careful decision-making is crucial. Once a decision is made, the focus should shift to working hard and figuring out how to progress, rather than dwelling on potential failures.
        
        The writer offers strategies to overcome this mindset. First, it's important to stop overthinking. Make thoughtful decisions and then commit to working diligently. Second, observe successful individuals in your field and learn from their experiences. Third, seek a coach or mentor who is already established in your field; their guidance can be invaluable.
        
        To sum up, the fear instinct can hinder our progress by causing excessive worry about failure. The key is to make careful decisions, work diligently, learn from successful role models, and seek guidance from mentors to navigate the path to success with confidence.</P>
